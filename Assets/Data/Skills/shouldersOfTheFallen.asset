  description: The Shoulders of the Fallen are a revered artifact said to have belonged
    to great leaders of a lost civilization. They possess the power to enhance Planet
    production, the extent of which is determined by the number of science boosts
    acquired. This makes the Shoulders a valuable addition to any empire seeking
    to increase its production and growth. The true nature and history of this powerful
    relic remains a mystery, but those who possess it are rumored to have an edge
    in their quest for expansion and prosperity.
