  displayName: Idle Electric Sheep
  description: Counting sheep is such a breeze, Helps me fall asleep with ease, One
    by one they jump the fence, Takes me to dreamland in suspense. <br>White and
    fluffy, soft and neat, Lead me to slumber so sweet, Close my eyes, take a deep
    breath, Counting sheep, I meet my rest. <br>Over the hills and far away, Sheep
    are counting every day, A bedtime ritual, tried and true, Helping me and maybe
    you.
  technicalDescription: Doubles the effect running offline time has.
